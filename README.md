## About

A **Dria Compute Node** is a unit of computation within the Dria Knowledge Network. It's purpose is to process tasks given by the **Dria Admin Node**, and receive rewards for providing correct results. These nodes are part of the [Waku](https://waku.org/) network, a privacy-preserving cencorship resistant peer-to-peer network.

### Heartbeat

Dria Admin Node broadcasts heartbeat messages at a set interval, it is a required duty of the compute node to respond to these so that they can be included in the list of available nodes for task assignment.

### Tasks

Compute nodes can technically do any arbitrary task, from computing the square root of a given number to finding LLM outputs from a given prompt. We currently have the following tasks:

- **Synthesis**: Generate synthetic data with respect to prompts given by the admin node.
- **Search**: Search the web using reasoning-and-action to answer a given query.
- **Validation**: Validate a given query-response pair. _(WIP)_

Tasks are enabled or disabled via the `DKN_TASKS` environment variable. Task names are to be provided in a list of comma-separated strings such as `DKN_TASKS=synthesis,search`.

### Waku

We are using a reduced version of [nwaku-compose](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku-compose) for the Waku node. It only uses the RELAY protocol, and STORE is disabled. The respective files are under the [waku](./waku/) folder.

By default, there are no static peers, but you can specify them using duplicate `--staticnode` arguments within the `WAKU_EXTRA_ARGS` variable which is passed to the Waku node, that is:

```sh
WAKU_EXTRA_ARGS="--staticnode=/ip4/foobar/... --staticnode=/ip4/bazboo/..."
```

## Usage

Dria Compute Node is mainly expected to be executed using `./start.sh`. To start running a node, you must do the following:

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firstbatchxyz/dkn-compute-node
```

1. **Prepare Environment Variables**: Dria Compute Node makes use of several environment variables, some of which used by Waku itself as well. First, prepare you environment variable as given in [.env.example](./.env.example).

1. **Fund an Ethereum Wallet with 0.1 Sepolia ETH**: Waku and Dria makes use of the same Ethereum wallet, and Waku uses RLN Relay protocol for further security within the network. If you have not registered to RLN protocol yet, register by running `./waku/register_rln.sh`. If you have already registered, you will have a `keystore.json` which you can place under `./waku/keystore/keystore.json` in this directory. Your secret key will be provided at `ETH_TESTNET_KEY` variable. You can set an optional password at `RLN_RELAY_CRED_PASSWORD` as well to encrypt the keystore file, or to decrypt it if you already have one.

1. **Ethereum Client RPC**: To communicate with Sepolia, you need an RPC URL. You can use [Infura](https://app.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/). Your URL will be provided at `ETH_CLIENT_ADDRESS` variable.

### Start the node

With all setup steps completed, you should be able to start a node with `./start.sh`

```sh
# Give exec permissions
chmod +x start.sh

# Check the available commands
./start.sh --help

# Example command for synthesis tasks
./start.sh --synthesis --synthesis-model-provider=ollama --synthesis-model=phi3

# Example command for search tasks 
./start.sh --search --search-model-provider=openai --search-model=gpt-4o

# Once you fill the .env file you can skip the given variables
# For instance, assume we have DKN_TASKS=synthesis and DKN_SYNTHESIS_MODEL_PROVIDER=ollama in the .env file
./start.sh --synthesis-model=llama3 # Only model name would be sufficient

# Example command for simultaneous search and synthesis tasks
./start.sh --synthesis --search
```

- With the `--local-ollama=true` option (default), the compute node will use the local Ollama server on the host machine. If the server is not running, the start script will initiate it with `ollama serve` and terminate it when stopping the node.
  - If `--local-ollama=false` or the local Ollama server is reachable, the compute node will use a Docker Compose service for it.
  - There are three Docker Compose Ollama options: `ollama-cpu`, `ollama-cuda`, and `ollama-rocm`. The start script will decide which option to use based on the host machine's GPU specifications.
- Start script will run the containers in the background. You can check their logs either via the terminal or from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### Run from Source

We are using Make as a wrapper for some scripts. You can see the available commands with:

```sh
make help
```

You will need OpenSSL installed as well, see shorthand commands [here](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/issues/855#issuecomment-450057552).

While running Waku and Ollama node elsewhere, you can run the compute node with:

```sh
make run      # info-level logs
make debug    # debug-level logs
```

#### Docs

Open crate docs using:

```sh
make docs
```

#### Testing

Besides the unit tests, there are separate tests for Waku network, and for compute tasks such as Ollama.

```sh
make test         # unit tests
make test-waku    # Waku tests (requires a running Waku node)
make test-ollama  # Ollama tests (requires a running Ollama client)
```

#### Benchmarking

To measure the speed of some Ollama models we have a benchmark that uses some models for a few prompts:

```sh
cargo run --release --example ollama
```

You can also benchmark these models using a larger task list at a given path, with the following command:

```sh
JSON_PATH="./path/to/your.json" cargo run --release --example ollama
```

#### Styling

Lint and format with:

```sh
make lint   # clippy
make format # rustfmt
```
